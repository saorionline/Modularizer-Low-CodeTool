        <p class="about-body">
          I built this service because Cali deserves better than generic Airbnb chaos.
          With expertise in <strong>property management</strong>, <strong>guest relations</strong>, 
          and <strong>local market dynamics</strong>, I operate at the intersection of hospitality 
          and real estate intelligence.
        </p>
        <p class="about-body">
          I work with <strong>US travelers</strong>, <strong>LATAM visitors</strong>, 
          and <strong>local renters</strong> who value quality over quantity — and 
          <strong>property owners</strong> who want professional management without the headaches.
